# movieproject
Sort the movies you download according to 4 categories: movies, children movies, tv shows and children tv shows. 
This app automatically checks what movies are already downloaded, gets the main infromation (such as overview, runtime, release date, director, cast, etc) about each movie and saves it to the database. It downloads the poster for every movie, too. All posters are stored in a separate folder. 
This app is build using Spring Boot.
